  abstract = {The integration of recovery and recapture data, providing information
	on the same individuals, is important for the stable fitting of a
	wide range of stochastic models, resulting in more realistic estimates
	of survival probabilities of wild animals than when either the recovery
	or recapture data are used separately. Previous integrated analyses
	have either concentrated on time-dependent parameters only or, in
	the age-dependent case, have not provided a flexible framework for
	model refinement and selection. We derive the likelihood for a general
	integrated model, allowing both age- and time-dependent parameters.
	The work of this paper was motivated by a set of recapture histories
	on shags (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), for which biological knowledge
	and previous data analysis suggest age dependence in both survival
	and recapture probabilities. We use these data to illustrate the
	general method. All model fitting is done by the method of maximum
	likelihood and the programming is done in Matlab. For the shags,
	we found an annual survival probability of 0.87 (standard error 0.01)
	for birds of breeding age and 0.70 (0.02) for birds in their second
	and third years. First-year survival varied widely with time about
	an average of 0.46.},

	history for a given body size. By allowing us to disentangle the

  abstract = {The understanding of the dynamics of animal populations and of related
	ecological and evolutionary issues frequently depends on a direct
	analysis of life history parameters. For instance, examination of
	trade-offs between reproduction and survival usually rely on individually
	marked animals, for which the exact time of death is most often unknown,
	because marked individuals cannot be followed closely through time.
	Thus, the quantitative analysis of survival studies and experiments
	must be based on capture-recapture (or resighting) models which consider,
	besides the parameters of primary interest, recapture or resighting
	rates that are nuisance parameters. Capture-recapture models oriented
	to estimation of survival rates are the result of a recent change
	in emphasis from earlier approaches in which population size was
	the most important parameter, survival rates having been first introduced
	as nuisance parameters. This emphasis on survival rates in capture-recapture
	models developed rapidly in the 1980s and used as a basic structure
	the Cormack-Jolly-Seber survival model applied to an homogeneous
	group of animals, with various kinds of constraints on the model
	parameters. These approaches are conditional on first captures; hence
	they do not attempt to model the initial capture of unmarked animals
	as functions of population abundance in addition to survival and
	capture probabilities. This paper synthesizes, using a common framework,
	these recent developments together with new ones, with an emphasis
	on flexibility in modeling, model selection, and the analysis of
	multiple data sets. The effects on survival and capture rates of
	time, age, and categorical variables characterizing the individuals
	(e.g., sex) can be considered, as well as interactions between such
	effects. This @'analysis of variance@' philosophy emphasizes the
	structure of the survival and capture process rather than the technical
	characteristics of any particular model. The flexible array of models
	encompassed in this synthesis uses a common notation. As a result
	of the great level of flexibility and relevance achieved, the focus
	is changed from fitting a particular model to model building and
	model selection. The following procedure is recommended: (1) start
	from a global model compatible with the biology of the species studied
	and with the design of the study, and assess its fit; (2) select
	a more parsimonious model using Akaike's Information Criterion to
	limit the number of formal tests; (3) test for the most important
	biological questions by comparing this model with neighboring ones
	using likelihood ratio tests; and (4) obtain maximum likelihood estimates
	of model parameters with estimates of precision. Computer software
	is critical, as few of the models now available have parameter estimators
	that are in closed form. A comprehensive table of existing computer
	software is provided. We used RELEASE for data summary and goodness-of-fit
	tests and SURGE for iterative model fitting and the computation of
	likelihood ratio tests. Five increasingly complex examples are given
	to illustrate the theory. The first, using two data sets on the European
	Dipper (Cinclus cinclus), tests for sex-specific parameters, explores
	a model with time-dependent survival rates, and finally uses a priori
	information to model survival allowing for an environmental variable.
	The second uses data on two colonies of the Swift (Apus apus), and
	shows how interaction terms can be modeled and assessed and how survival
	and recapture rates sometimes partly counterbalance each other. The
	third shows complex variation in survival rates across sexes and
	age classes in the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), with a test of
	density dependence in annual survival rates. The fourth is an example
	of experimental density manipulation using the common lizard (Lacerta
	vivipara). The last example attempts to examine a large and complex
	data set on the Greater Flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber), where parameters
	are age specific, survival is a function of an environmental variable,
	and an age x year interaction term is important. Heterogeneity seems
	present in this example and cannot be adequately modeled with existing
	theory. The discussion presents a summary of the paradigm we recommend
	and details issues in model selection and design, and foreseeable
	future developments.},

  abstract = {This paper points out and discusses several practical and methodological
	problems that arise in attempts to detect and measure senescent declines
	in survival or breeding performance of wild animals, with specific
	emphasis on long-lived seabirds. Birds have no anatomical markers
	of age, so studies of age-related biology require marking individuals
	at the time of hatching and following them throughout their lives.
	Seabirds live longer than the working lifespan of biologists, and
	longer than the turnover times of study techniques or theories of
	senescence. Seabirds are exposed to changing environmental and demographic
	conditions and cannot be assumed to be in demographic equilibrium.
	Sample sizes of the oldest age-classes are always small, requiring
	either marking very large numbers of birds at hatching or continuing
	studies of old birds over many years. Incomplete sampling requires
	the use of mark-recapture models that have only been developed in
	the last 20years. Mortality selection resulting from demographic
	heterogeneity (selective survival of high-quality individuals) can
	offset or confound the effects of senescent changes within individuals.
	Many of these problems are amenable to solution and will be probably
	solved within a few years. In the meantime, this paper recommends
	that reviewers should be cautious about accepting published reports
	of senescent declines in natural populations.},

	at Marion Island, and a consistent recapture program yielded data
	that was analysed using the software package MARK to obtain maximum-likelihood
	estimates of survival and capture probability. On average, Ist-year
	survival was 0.58 and 0.62, and survival rate averaged over the first
	3 years of life, 0.69 and 0.74 for males and females, respectively.
	From years 4 to 9, the average survival rate was 0.66 and 0.75 for
	males and females, respectively. Survival estimates for elephant
	seals in their 10th-13th year are also presented, although these
	are based on very small sample sizes. Averages of age-specific survival
	estimates from the earlier (mostly 1983-1987 cohorts) and later (mostly
	1988-1992 cohorts) periods were compared and considerable reductions
	were observed in 4th- and 5th-year male survival, and 4th-year female
	survival. The comparatively low adult survival is suggested as the
	proximate cause, and food limitation as deduced from the decline
	in survival of elephant seals with comparatively high energetic demands
	as the ultimate cause behind the population decline at Marion Island.
	Although not tied in with the decline of the population, 1987, 1990
	and 1993 were identified as high-mortality years.},

  pages = {85--102},

  abstract = {I review the use of auxiliary variables in capture-recapture models
	for estimation of demographic parameters (e. g. capture probability,
	population size, survival probability, and recruitment, emigration
	and immigration numbers). I focus on what has been done in cur rent
	research and what still needs to be done. Typically in the literature,
	covariate modelling has made capture and survival probabilities functions
	of covariates, but there are good reasons also to make other parameters
	functions of covariates as well. The types of covariates considered
	include environmental covariates that may vary by occasion but are
	constant over animals, and individual animal covariates that are
	usually assumed constant over time. I also discuss the difficulties
	of using time-dependent individual animal covariates and some possible
	solutions. Covariates are usually assumed to be measured without
	error, and that may not be realistic.For closed populations, one
	approach to modelling heterogeneity in capture probabilities uses
	observable individual covariates and is thus related to the primary
	pur pose of this paper. The now standard Huggins-Alho approach conditions
	on the captured animals and then uses a generalized Horvitz-Thompson
	estimator to estimate population size. This approach has the advantage
	of simplicity in that one does not have to specify a distribution
	for the covariates, and the disadvantage is that it does not use
	the full likelihood to estimate population size. Alternately one
	could specify a distribution for the covariates and implement a full
	likelihood approach to inference to estimate the capture function,
	the covariate probability distribution, and the population size.The
	general Jolly-Seber open model enables one to estimate capture probability,
	population sizes, survival rates, and birth numbers. Much of the
	focus on modelling covariates in program MARK has been for survival
	and capture probability in the Cormack-Jolly-Seber model and its
	generalizations (including tag-return models). These models condition
	on the number of animals marked and released. A related, but distinct,
	topic is radio telemetry survival modelling that typically uses a
	modified Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model for
	auxiliary variables. Recently there has been an emphasis on integration
	of recruitment in the likelihood, and research on how to implement
	covariate modelling for recruitment and perhaps population size is
	needed. The combined open and closed 'robust' design model can also
	benefit from covariate modelling and some important options have
	already been implemented into MARK. Many models are usually fitted
	to one data set. This has necessitated development of model selection
	criteria based on the AIC (Akaike Information Criteria) and the alter
	native of averaging over reasonable models. The special problems
	of estimating over-dispersion when covariates are included in the
	model and then adjusting for over-dispersion in model selection could
	benefit from further research.},

	used in the analysis were limited to 27, 4 through 19, and 20 or
	more as a final age category because data on gulls over 20 were sparse.
	Survival declined with age in a way that was parsimoniously modelled
	with a quadratic function. Other factors, sex and time, did not explain
	any variation in survival. Resighting depended on age, sex and time.
	Younger adults skipped breeding more frequently than did older adults,
	and females skipped breeding more frequently than did males. There
	was also good evidence for time dependence in resighting probability,
	but its inclusion in the model occurred at the expense of interpretability
	and precision. In a data set such as this, resighting probability
	may assume more importance than a mere 'nuisance parameter'. In this
	study, resighting history measured attendance at the breeding ground.
	In turn, attendance rates may be a manifestation of reproductive
	strategy, which can also have consequences for survival. In this
	situation, there may be heterogeneity in both survival and resighting
	probability that is unexplained by the model. While such complexity
	may well be a nuisance to deal with, it can also point to important
	biological questions.},

	Rate of aging is most closely related to brain size in birds and
