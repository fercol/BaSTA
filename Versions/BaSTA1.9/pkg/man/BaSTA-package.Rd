\title{
BaSTA: a package for parametric Bayesian estimation of age-specific survival for truncated and censored capture-recapture/recovery records.
}

\description{
This package estimates survival trajectories with covariates from capture-recapture/recovery data in a Bayesian framework when many individuals are of unknown age. It includes tools for data checking, model diagnostics, and outputs such as life-tables and plots.
